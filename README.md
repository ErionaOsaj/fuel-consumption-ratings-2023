# Fuel Consumption Ratings 2023 - Data Preprocessing and Visualization

## Team Members

## Introduction
This dataset contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles available for retail sale in Canada. The data has been adjusted to reflect 5-cycle testing, making it easier to compare vehicles from different model years. It includes information on various vehicle attributes and their environmental impact, which can be used to make informed decisions about fuel-efficient vehicles.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Year
- Make
- Model
- Vehicle Class
- Engine Size (L)
- Cylinders
- Transmission
- Fuel Type
- Fuel Consumption (L/100 km)
- Hwy (L/100 km)
- Comb (L/100 km)
- Comb (mpg)
- CO2 Emissions (g/km)
- CO2 Rating
- Smog Rating

## Data Preprocessing
In this Jupyter Notebook, we will perform the following data preprocessing steps:
1. Data Cleaning: We will check for and handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. Data Formatting: We will format columns to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.
3. Data Transformation: We may create new features or transform existing ones to better suit our analysis and visualization.

## Data Visualization
We will utilize various Python libraries for data visualization, including but not limited to:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

Our visualization goals include:
- Exploring the distribution of fuel consumption across different vehicle classes.
- Analyzing the relationship between engine size, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.
- Visualizing trends in fuel consumption and emissions over the years.

## Tools and Environment
We have used Jupyter Notebook for the analysis and visualization.
The analysis is performed using Python v3.11.5.
The required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are included in the Anaconda distribution.
